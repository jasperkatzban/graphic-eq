- low-latency playback

### FEATURES
- ~~intake audio stream~~
- ~~take fft of audio~~
- ~~output audio stream~~
- filter audio based on:
    - ~~preset constants~~
    - ~~gui sliders~~ (sorta -- need to do real-time as opposed to one-and-done)

- space bar music play/pause
- documentation website

### IMPLEMENTATION
- ~~filter math~~
    - ~~lowpass~~
    - ~~highpass~~
